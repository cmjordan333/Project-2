The Story
East Coast vs West Coast (Geolocation/Heatmap/scrape)
Lyrics per decade (Dataviz/csv's/scrape)
Themes in rap (Dataviz/csv's/scrape)

The Question:  What is the overarching theme in HipHop music across all decades?
How do we answer the question?  Analyze the words being spoken in rap lyrics across all decades, compare them across the decades, and see if we can extrapolate meaning from the message.
